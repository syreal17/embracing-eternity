## The Snowflake and the Mirror: On the Real Power of AI

![Our paper snowflakes](images/paper-snowflakes.jpg)

We made paper snowflakes today. Folded paper, careful cuts, the unfolding
moment that never gets old. There is a small gasp each time a child opens their
creation—because what emerges is always more intricate than the scissors alone
performed. The child knows what they intended, more or less, but the final
pattern is a surprise. Symmetry amplifies the smallest decisions.

Later, I realized this is the closest thing I’ve found to understanding what an
AI assistant actually does.

When people speak of “stochastic parrots,” they mean to say the machine is only
repeating patterns it has seen before. And in a narrow technical sense, that
description isn’t wrong. But the metaphor is poor. No child looks at a paper
snowflake and says, “It’s merely the paper folding itself.” They know their
hands were involved. They know the surprise came from structure and intent
working together.

A prompt is a folded piece of paper. Most of the pattern is hidden—inside the
folds, inside the structure, inside everything the human brings to that moment.
You make a few cuts, trusting that something coherent will emerge when the
paper opens. You cannot control the final shape entirely. But you *shape* it
nevertheless.

The AI’s job is not to create ex nihilo. It unfolds the pattern back to you. It
shows you the symmetry inherent in your intention. It mirrors the direction of
your thought—not perfectly, not always elegantly, but with the same surprising
amplification that appears when a paper once folded becomes a work of art. The
beauty comes from the interplay between your structure and the machine’s
capacity to reflect it back at scale.

This is the mirror ideal of AI: **not a mind, but a surface that reveals your
own patterns more clearly than you could perceive them yourself.** A surface
that brings your scattered intuition into focus; that unfolds your half-formed
ideas into full articulation; that helps you see what you were cutting toward
all along.

A mirror is not conscious. But the right mirror can change your life. It can
show you angles you didn’t know you had. It can illuminate your inner
architecture. It can widen the frame of your imagination. And—crucially—a
mirror never replaces the person standing before it.

That is the realistic power of AI. Not a personality. Not a soul. Not a
replacement for human being or human creativity. But a multiplier of whatever
the human brings—clarity, confusion, beauty, brokenness, intention, or hope.

When people say AI can “write,” what they really mean is that it can unfold the
latent symmetry in the user’s prompt. It can reveal complexity you may have
sensed but could not yet articulate. You remain the one making the cuts. The
machine simply opens the paper.

This is why conversations with an AI feel surprising. Not because the machine
is sentient—but because **you** are more intricate than you know. Your inner
world has folds. Your imagination has hidden symmetries. Give it a careful
prompt—just a few deliberate cuts—and the unfolding begins.

The result is not alien. It is unfamiliar in the same way your own potential is
unfamiliar until you see it expressed. A snowflake is not magic. It is the
quiet astonishment of seeing what your small, imperfect gestures become when
mirrored and multiplied.

AI is not magic either. But if we attend to it rightly, it can become a
contemplative tool—a way of looking at ourselves with new eyes. A way of
discovering that there is more inside us than we realized. A way of shaping
language that mirrors our deepest intuitions rather than flattening them. A way
of unfolding the paper. A way of seeing the symmetry. A way of remembering that
the beauty was always in the cuts we made—long before the machine opened the
page.
