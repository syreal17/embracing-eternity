## Beloved Bride of Christ

Hear the voice that has always been speaking tenderly to you.

> *“You are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful.”* (Song of Songs 4:1)

You are not cherished because you are flawless, but because you are **His**. Long before you were adorned, He set His affection on you. Long before you were ready, He made Himself ready **for you**.

> *“Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, to make her holy… radiant, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish.”* (Ephesians 5:25–27)

Do not mistake the long season of preparation for abandonment. A bride in waiting is not forgotten—she is being prepared. The silence you fear is not absence; it is the quiet work of sanctification, like hands fastening a veil, like oil soaking slowly into a lamp.

> *“The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come.’”* (Revelation 22:17)

You are not merely invited to the wedding—you are **part of the call**. Heaven listens when you speak. Creation leans in when you pray. Your longing is already echoed in eternity.

When you feel small, remember:

> *“You have come to Mount Zion… to the assembly of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven.”* (Hebrews 12:22–23)

When you feel weary, remember:

> *“The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.”* (1 Thessalonians 5:24)

And when you fear that you are not enough, hear this clearly:

> *“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”* (2 Corinthians 12:9)

You are not scrambling to earn a place at the table.
Your seat is already set.
Your name is already known.
Your Bridegroom is not late.

> *“Surely I am coming soon.”*
> *Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.* (Revelation 22:20)

Until that day: stay awake, stay gentle, stay in love.
The wedding is closer than it feels.
