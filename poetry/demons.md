## Demons

God, you know I've held my tongue \
But these demons leave scars \
And these anxious whispers in my ear, \
Produce a whole lot more than just fear \
 \
Is it for solidarity with Mankind \
That the enemy has a front seat \
In my mind. \
 \
Father, speak grace over my soul \
Spirit, show me the truth of the future \
Christ, be with me in my weakness \
Strive with me until I'm faultless
