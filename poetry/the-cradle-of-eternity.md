## The Cradle of Eternity

I found the Silence \
One day \
And it was like a quiet friend, \
One that never says much \
But would stick till the end. \
I've learned to love those pauses, \
I've come to enjoy the waiting— \
For what you say will change me \
And am I ready \
To never be the same? \
 \
I sit beside that Silence \
And lean into its grace, \
Its stillness holds a question \
I see mirrored on my face. \
It asks me not for answers, \
Not for clever turns of phrase, \
Just presence in its presence, \
Just patience in its gaze. \
 \
I used to run from you, \
The terrors of the depths \
Seemed drawn to you. \
I tried to fill you with noise and words \
And never let you sit. \
But now after some years \
I see that you are not some nuisance, \
But rather \
The Cradle of Eternity. \
 \
So now I rest within you, \
Letting shadows drift and play, \
No longer rushing past you, \
But letting you have your say. \
You hold what I can’t fathom, \
You soften every edge, \
You offer me a threshold \
Not a cliff, but a ledge. \
 \
So now I sing with so many \
That have also conquered fear, \
And invite you to their table \
As an honored guest, all year.
