## ecstasy

ecstasy \
like a moment \
frozen in time \
captured by \
a picture \
shared, all-wise \
 \
nothing has ecstasy \
like a lofi beat \
that feeling \
of everything \
being right \
 \
overcast, winter's day \
will your beat \
ever fail to make me sway? \
 \
nothing has ecstasy \
like bumpin songs in \
the back seat \
while Dad drives to \
some unknown paradise \
 \
ecstasy I can almost conjure \
bolstered by some lofi songs \
We wear them out of the vinyl \
But they never get old
