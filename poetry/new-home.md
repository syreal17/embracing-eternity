I led you to a place \
Far, far away \
Where the stars \
were much crisper. \
Where nothing \
Could take us away. \
 \
A world, all of our own \
To be explored and roamed \
We wandered for days \
Every climb an ascent \
to awe-inspiring moutainscape \
 \
Do you like living in my head? \
Are these exciting places to play? \
She smiled and said: \
I would have it no other way \
We've wandered past the edge of existence \
And been back to Earth in one day \
 \
The depths of space are our backyard \
God is our companion \
Can we ever stray too far or wander too hard? \
No, I'll always be waiting for you at these vistas \
Taking in the limitless expanse of our freedom
