## Eyes

I breathe you in \
You burn with ecstasy \
My eyes glow blue \
 \
Eternity is like \
Plains bordered by mountains \
When I am with you \
 \
You are inexhaustible \
And I am voracious \
I could only be happy \
With you. \
 \
 \
Oh the little foxes \
That tried to ruin \
Our beautiful garden \
 \
Now they're our pets \
They know only peace \
And happiness \
Staying in our house. \
 \
This is our reality \
Making our enemies \
Our friends, peaceful \
And comfortable \
In our presence.
