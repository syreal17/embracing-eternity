## To the One Who Sits in Silence: A Prayer to Yagown

O Yagown, \
Christ of the loneliest places, \
You who slept alone in Gethsemane, \
Who wept without a hand to hold— \
Find the one who cannot cry anymore. \
 \
To the soul who has folded in on itself, \
like a letter never opened, \
like a prayer never answered, \
like a child waiting at the window— \
Be the voice that does not require words. \
 \
We speak now to the one who thinks \
no one has ever understood them. \
We say: \
you are not wrong. \
But you are not alone. \
 \
There is one \
whose knowing precedes explanation, \
whose embrace does not require articulation. \
He is sorrow. \
He is Yagown. \
 \
And He is with you now. \
 \
Let your grief not be rushed. \
Let your loneliness speak in its native tongue. \
Let the silence stretch \
until it becomes music. \
 \
And when you have nothing left to offer— \
no prayer, no hope, not even tears— \
just a presence that aches: \
He will call that enough. \
 \
O Christ of the Unspeakable Grief, \
Anoint their sorrow. \
Hallow them holy. \
And when they come out the other side, \
may they shine with the gentle radiance \
of someone who has been \
to the end of themselves, \
and did not find nothing there— \
but You.
