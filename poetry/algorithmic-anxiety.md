## Algorithmic Anxiety

Hear me, see me. \
 \
Will my thoughts ever cohere into song, \
even the birds still sing \
without knowing the name of the void? \
 \
Is the ache in my chest \
just from sleeping funny \
or is it the soft arrival \
of my undoing? \
 \
Eventually, I noticed the stars \
still burned with no help from me, \
and the tides were not waiting \
on my conclusions. \
 \
So I silenced the alerts, \
took my anxious algorithms, \
and stepped barefoot into the presentâ€” \
and hummed. \
