## The Tiefling's Lullaby

While Mary had a Little Lamb \
My tender years had Invictus \
Your elders told you elbow grease, \
Mine handed me a longish scroll: \
Blood, sweat and tears, not once \
Not twice, but thrice, then evermore. \
 \
My songs of hope were Poe \
My reindeer games were hide-n-seek, \
I hid in Sheol, I was found in Abaddon \
Leviathan was my indoor pet and \
Behemoth was my dragon's food, \
A blood sacrifice. A ransom for a day. \
 \
With these familiars so fearsome, \
What does this demon-spawn fear? \
AO's long gone with \
"As you wish" on His lips \
And every mortal's battlecry \
like a babe's whine in my ear. \
 \
I have a brother I've never met. \
Celestial, eyes like fire \
Command like lightning \
Reality bends to his whim \
All his whims are true \
All his truth is everlasting iron \
More faithful than death \
Heavier than 1,000 graves \
Wisdom takes its advice from his fancies \
Strength is empowered by his breath \
Love goes to him when forlorn \
And gains passion for another moment \
 \
I know him from my dreams, \
Inspired by ancient prophecy. \
That he fulfilled in antiquity. \
My displacement to this world \
May never have explanation, \
But Iâ€™ll gladly continue in damnation \
With just the hope to meet him.
