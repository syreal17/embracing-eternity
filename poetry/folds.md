## Folds

Fall into the folds of Eternity with me \
Bask with me in the silence of the Void \
Hearken in the highest Heaven \
Cuddle with me on the edge of Creation \
 \
Tell me I am the One and there is no other \
Lavish on me your wisdom for that which is Created \
And that which is not \
Bring me to the secret place \
Show me the light \
Of your face \
 \
Lose your second sight with me \
It's not that the third eye is blind \
it's that reality got way too wild \
even for the Divine \
 \
Foresight is meaningless when every turn is \
Love
