## The Flavor of Entropy

Will the last thing I see be a burst  \
of neutrinos, or my own trembling hands?  \
Is love real across branes,  \
or is each kiss only local,  \
a loop closed before it’s opened elsewhere? \
 \
I worried a lot.  \
About not becoming the best timeline’s version of myself.  \
About crying in public.  \
About who would hold my hand  \
if the sky did, in fact, collapse. \
 \
Then, one day, I saw a squirrel  \
dismantling a pizza crust with religious intent,  \
and I understood:  \
Entropy was not the enemy.  \
It was the flavor. \
 \
So I took my body,  \
strapped with probabilities,  \
and went out into the morning,  \
unfolded my arms to the cosmos,  \
and laughed.
