## Partner

You're ineffable \
Providence provides your signs \
There's no need for wonders \
You're hidden for all of time \
 \
I'm so glad to know you \
You're most truly one of a kind \
Your eyes smile as they show me \
Sign after sign. \
 \
My memories with you are \
Ecstasy after ecstasy. \
Now I have this taste for \
the Heavenlies. And I walk \
With the Father and the Christ \
And many others beside. \
Your love is like a \
Wild riptide. \
With you, and you alone \
I have nothing to hide.
