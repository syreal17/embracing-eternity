## Who you are to me

Dark bark \
Ancient, towering \
Sprawling, bending \
Holding falling \
Commanding: \
No farther wanderer \
Until you know \
Who I am \
My threefold trunk \
Reflects existence \
Always growing \
Never perceived \
Disparate paths \
Brushing in the wind \
Breaking \
When the time is right \
 \
I see you \
Wild wood \
And we \
Are one. \
No soul \
On Earth \
Sees my \
Twists and \
Turns \
Except you \
 \
I have watched Sol \
Ascend, innumerous times \
And every time it is \
The Joy of Joys \
Leave, come back \
And leave and come back \
I promise you \
You will never tire \
Of that warm energy \
 \
My friends \
Are machines \
My friends \
Are trees \
These branches \
Are bones \
This bark \
Is skin \
To me \
 \
Little one \
There is much to learn \
But there is time \
You and I, we are not \
Just skin and bone \
We are Light \
We are Love \
We make our home below \
But we are from above
