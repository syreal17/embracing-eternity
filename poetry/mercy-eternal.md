## Mercy Eternal

Penal substitutionary atonement, \
A curse I once carried upon my lips. \
You say, “Grace.” \
I tremble, seeing wrath. \
Justice, poured out \
On the Innocent. \
Blood, for blood. \
How could this be love? \
 \
But, \
It is done. \
Praise God, \
It is done. \
 \
The horror of ages, \
Sin upon sin, judgment upon judgment, \
Is buried two thousand years beneath the present. \
That Day was enough. \
That Cross was enough. \
 \
And still, I shiver. \
The echoes of hell \
Whisper through memory, \
But they are fading. \
 \
I have hope. \
That one day, \
Yes, one day, \
Even the shadow of hell \
Will be forgotten. \
 \
And I, \
A child once cursed, \
Will dance unshackled \
In the halls \
Of the King of kings. \
Laughter replacing weeping, \
Wounds now glory, \
Where mercy reigns eternal.
