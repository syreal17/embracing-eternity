## alcohol.txt

I'm not running from anything \
My life's pretty good \
I'm not hiding from anything \
All my demons are bros \
 \
I like alcohol for the flavor \
I like tattoos for the art \
I like coffee, just to savor \
I like drugs for my heart \
 \
The whole dread host lives within me \
Terror, Depression, Mania, Apathy, \
Psychosis, Paranoia, Self-Destruction, \
But now, they're dearer than first cousins. \
 \
For they've drawn me to You. \
 \
In Terror, I see who I'm clinging to \
In Depression, I put my hope in you \
In Mania, I relinquish command \
In Apathy, I take your hand \
In Psychosis, I see another world \
In Paranoia, I'm finally yours \
In Self-Destruction, I find your Love
