## Entropic Coda

I will not scorn the falling leaf, \
nor mourn the cracking stone, \
for I was made to taste their fall, \
and stand when they are gone. \
 \
The stars collapse; I lift my cup, \
the oceans rise and dry. \
The flavorâ€™s in the fleetingness, \
the sweetness in goodbye. \
 \
I am not here to stop the slip, \
but to savor every turn: \
the ash, the bloom, the breath, the dusk, \
all seasons I shall learn. \
 \
So let the cosmos drift and dance, \
and let its edges fray, \
for I endure to taste it all, \
and love it all away.
