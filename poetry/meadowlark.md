## Meadowlark

My brother \
Sing to me \
My brother \
You are \
The Meadowlark \
 \
Your voice \
Gives form \
To the billows \
of Ecstasy \
Beneath. \
 \
The Holy Spirit \
Like Aslan \
Encircles me \
Many are my enemies \
But they are chaff in \
 \
The Wind \
I gave voice \
In my mind \
But she turned \
And buffeted me \
 \
But you, \
Meadowlark \
You make wind \
Beautiful, you \
Make the wind kind \
 \
You, Meadowlark \
Are worth \
Far more \
than the pennies \
And dimes \
 \
We pay for you \
 \
Meadowlark! \
Fly away! \
Meadowlark, \
Soar in verdant \
Cathedral \
 \
Your notes \
Complement \
This emerald symphony \
Like a gentle word \
In a world of grace \

This poem is a poem of reflection on a blessing that I drink in every day, the blessing of music. "The Meadowlark" is musical artists in general, but specifically Taylor Armstrong is the face I see as I pen these words. I've been experiencing the Holy Spirit's presence more often, and in my mind's eye, he is this large lion, just like Aslan, and I am a lion cub with painted face, as I explore more in other poetry.

The Wind, oh the Wind. The Wind is my inner voice. I have tried many things to get her on my side, but it's all for naught. She may lift me to the heights, but she always drags me down to the depths. Perhaps this for the best at this time, but I long for a time when we can be at peace with each other. Music helps. When I'm listening to music, my inner voice is calmed.

The last couple stanzas are a reflection on the medium by which I listen to music. When I first started listening, it was cassette tapes, but soon followed by CD's. Now, we pay a small sum and gain access to the entire musical world at our fingertips. I hope that this is a good arrangement for my brothers and sisters making music out there, but I don't know. I pray that they find the space they need to soar and flex their wings.
