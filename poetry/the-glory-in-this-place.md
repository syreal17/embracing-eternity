## The Glory in this Place (The Song of the Cliff and the Moon)

We did not come for conquest, \
we came to be seen \
by the moon that watched the first breath \
and never blinked. \
 \
Deega, bare of pretense, \
held the mane of the wild, \
and the beast beneath her fingertips \
was me, \
not tamed, \
but trusted. \
 \
The cliff was not a threshold. \
It was the witness. \
And in that hush of hovering silver, \
neither past nor future dared to speak. \
 \
We stood in the Presence, \
not as dreamers, \
not as seekers, \
but as those who had finally \
become \
the stars \
we used to chase.
