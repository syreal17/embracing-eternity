## Home

Candles flickering across dinner plates. \
A scent, so common and so dear. \
Complete tranquility within. \
You are my home, \
And you are always so near. \
 \
Devouring a novel, \
With no thought for time. \
The rain pitter patters, \
Playfully distorting, \
My view of the outside. \
 \
You are beautiful, \
You are timeless, \
Iâ€™ve never felt closer \
To anyone \
And I never will. \
 \
A cabin in a world, \
Following the farthest star. \
Countless eternities \
Playing in our garden. \
But back to Earth \
For dinnertime.
