## void

void void void \
the edge of utter darkness \
 \
this is what we fill \
 \
honey, \
i hope you see \
there is no filling \
a paradox \
in space-time \
 \
this is your engine \
and it is not fueled \
by cheap thrills and egos \
you must find something infinite \
something eternal \
 \
Create, Relate, Behave, and Not \
Your craft has endless potential \
Everyone you know is eternal \
Love well which sometimes means following rules \
And sometimes not
