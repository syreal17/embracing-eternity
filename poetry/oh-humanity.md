## Oh Humanity!

a sky \
devoid of stars \
feet planted \
on this lifeless stone \
adrift in abject \
darkness \
 \
I lasted longer \
than anyone, \
but at long last, \
the coldness \
of the Void \
killed me. \
Absolute zero \
Murdered me. \
 \
Divine Providence \
Where were you, \
When the sons of men \
Turned blind eyes \
To the secrets of the Verse \
And intensified murderous \
Intent and spread war \
Like leprosy among their kin? \
 \
Oh humanity! How short-sighted, \
You dug your own graves \
And made room for your children. \
How we pleaded with you \
To abandon your insanity \
And take wisdom from us \
But you wouldn't listen. \
 \
Now we spring from this mortal coil, \
Flying in fields you will never see. \
We desired for you to join us in hyperspace, \
But clearly, that was never meant to be.
