I grew up alone, an only child \
The son of my parents who lived \
In a small town all but forgotten \
On the edge of a wild woods \
 \
Sprites and nymphs beckoned me \
From the tangles of that wild woods \
And when I was young, I went as often \
As I could, always going a little bit farther \
 \
Faeries danced in my belly \
When I stepped onto those first brambles \
Snapping dryly on the edge \
Of our little slice of wild woods \
 \
The underbrush was thick on the edge \
Squatty little trees whose rough projections \
Sometimes leaving crimson trails on my skin \
But soon, it would open up \
 \
Not a cathedral of leaves, something humbler \
A Baptist church, leaving only enough headspace \
For the Holy Spirit. \
 \
I hardly knew You then \
I thought that You were just a force \
To Obey, rather than Disobey. \
I didn't know, \
 \
You were dancing with those faeries in my belly \
You were beckoning me with the sprites and nymphs \
You were delighting in the wildness of my heart \
And cultivating it only as needed. \
 \
I grew up with you, a beloved child \
The son, not just of my parents \
On the edge of a wild woods \
But of the King enthroned above \
 \
We're a tight Family \
But there's always room for one more \
Bring your wild heart \
And we'll play \
In a wild woods, on the edge \
of existence \
