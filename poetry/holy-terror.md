## Holy Terror

Behold how the sun was blackened \
And every human jaw was slackened \
As the stars fell from space \
And light screamed from His mane \
His name is too wonderful to speak \
His roar, like hosts of angelic speech \
He's as Almighty as He is meek \
But now, it's justice He seeks \
And His lightning is pure mercy \
As it levels mountains \
And fills in the deep. \
His eyes, who can meet? \
Like the stars consumed by \
A thousand black holes, unsheathed \
His breath, like the heat of Sol \
And a crown of thorns, like a wreath \
This is the One who is truly King \
These things, and a thousand thousand \
Others, too wonderful to believe \
I saw as the Earth was pulled \
From time and space.
