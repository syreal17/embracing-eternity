## Your name

an adorning crown \
90 on the highway \
in the dead of night \
a word that releases \
100 seconds of tension \
the wild dog in the city \
under the full moon light \
speaking words I don't know \
but fully convinced of their \
Might \
 \
Druidic rituals never taught \
to me, proceeding with the \
baptism to the fullest degree \
my Spirit has been to places \
I've never seen, but they are \
Home to me \
 \
talking through trees \
connecting to Sol \
Time slow and fast \
Slower and faster \
Drifting in the asteroid belt \
We all grow old \
But sometimes \
I feel a little \
Younger
