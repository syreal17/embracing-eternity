## I am Found

I don't know when it happened \
God gave me his name \
I don't know exactly what changed \
But nothing was ever the same \
 \
I don't know what it means \
But all my demons \
Have names and faces. \
I extend grace to them \
Some turn to face it \
Others run the opposite direction \
 \
I cuddle up with Father \
Like a child in his lap \
I have never known such peace \
But he has me purring like a cat \
 \
I've looked in the distance \
And seen the vultures circling. \
I've felt the infernal weight \
of dread prophecy, approaching like a titan \
Destroying everything in its wake \
 \
Christ has delivered me \
from all my fears. \
He is my joyful confidence, \
He wipes away my tears. \
 \
The Spirit bears me away on wings like eagles \
He takes me to the secret place, far far away \
He refreshes me with true friendship \
My heart overflows \
 \
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me \
They may not always be knocking on my door \
But in the end, they will make their home with me \
In the end, we will be together, because of the Lord.
