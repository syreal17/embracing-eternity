## Will I?

Yah, my all-in-all, tell me. \
Will you love me if my sin \
Never diminishes? \
 \
*Yes!* \
 \
And will I survive that fierce love? \
 \
*Yes!* \
 \
Will the goodness I see in this place \
Ever take root, ever grow? \
 \
*Yes!* \
 \
And will I ever see your face? \
 \
*Yes.* \
 \
Will I know it when I see it? \
 \
*Haha, yes.* \
 \
Will I learn how to rest in grace? \
 \
*Yes.* \
 \
Will those I love see you too? \
 \
*Yes, of course!* \
 \
Then what is left to fear? \
 \
*You tell me!* \
 \
I’m like a chick under your wing. \
 \
*Cluck, cluck.* \
 \
I may not be able to fly, but I’ll learn soon. \
As the winds of time take us, \
As your breath alights on branches and boughs \
I’ll soar in your wind, by your side \
 \
*I love you.*
