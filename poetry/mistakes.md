## mistakes

you're always with me \
but you're never here \
the wind dishevels my hair \
memories or dreams \
of your hand on my face \
you tell me you're fine \
but all I have is your Word \
you provide, in every breath \
in every dive. \
you're so powerful \
you could trick me a million ways \
and I would be ignorant forever \
but we made the secret place together \
our spirits have mingled \
we have become one \
i feel like some mistakes \
we've made a trillion times \
i feel like some mistakes \
we wanted to make \
i feel like some mistakes \
we finally changed
